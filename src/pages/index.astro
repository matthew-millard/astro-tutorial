    <h1>Welcome To My Blog</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      I'm excited to start share with you my technical insights and guides on all things web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of this blog is to document my coding journey and share the insights and solutions I've picked up
      along the way with other developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I began learning to code in January 2023, one of the biggest takeaways has been this: the cleanest and most
      effective solutions are often found in documentation or in articles/blog posts written by other developers who
      have run into the same issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve come to realize that I retain knowledge far better when I take the time to teach what I’ve learned—whether
      that’s breaking down a tricky concept, walking through a solution, or simply reflecting on what worked (and what
      didn’t).
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is my way of contributing back to the developer community while reinforcing my own learning. Thanks for
      stopping by—and I hope you find something here that helps you.
